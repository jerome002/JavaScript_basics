#  JavaScript Learning Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository!  
This repo contains small programs and exercises I created to build a solid foundation in JavaScript using **Node.js**.

##  Project: Number Checker

This script demonstrates:
- How to use the `readline` module to accept input from the terminal.
- Function creation and invocation in JavaScript.
- Control flow using `if-else` and `switch-case`.

###  What It Does
- Prompts the user to enter a number.
- Tells whether the number is **even** or **odd**.
- Prints a message if the number is **1, 2, or 3** (or something else).
- Delays program exit for 10 seconds after the output.

###  Technologies Used
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (JavaScript runtime)
- Built-in `readline` module for handling user input
